Simple Adaboost Implementation for Viola Jones Algorithm
---------------------------------------------------------

This project contains scripts for implementation of Adaboost
for Viola Jones algorithm for robust dace detection.

The algorithm can be running adaboost.m script.

Documentation as well as code in well commented form can be found in
html folder.

Images are taken from open source image database, MIT.

This script was used to demonstrate Adaboost in workshops held in Perceptron
(http://iitbhu.ac.in/prastuti/perceptron) under Prastuti '14.
